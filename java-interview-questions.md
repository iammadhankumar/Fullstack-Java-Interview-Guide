The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a development platform for developing and running Java applications, including a compiler, libraries, and other tools. It's essential for writing, compiling, and testing Java programs.

The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a part of JDK. It is a software layer for running the Java programs. It includes everything needed to run Java applications such as the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and libraries.

The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that executes Java programs by running bytecode instructions. It converts bytecode into native machine code, allowing the program to run on various operating systems.
