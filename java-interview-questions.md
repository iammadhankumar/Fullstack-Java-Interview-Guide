# Java Technical Interview Questions

## Core Java Concepts :

### Core Components of Java Execution :

#### 1. What is the difference between JDK and JRE and JVM ?

The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a development platform for developing and running Java applications, including a compiler, libraries, and other tools. It's essential for writing, compiling, and testing Java programs.

The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a part of JDK. It is a software layer for running the Java programs. It includes everything needed to run Java applications such as the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and libraries.

The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that executes Java programs by running bytecode instructions. It converts bytecode into native machine code, allowing the program to run on various operating systems.

#### 2. Why is Java a platform independent language ?
Java is platform-independent because it compiles Java code into bytecode. The JVM then converts this bytecode into machine-readable code and allowing Java to run on various operating systems.

#### 3. Explain java compiler ?
The Java compiler converts Java code into bytecode, and this bytecode can be executed by any device with a JVM.

#### 4. What is JIT compiler ?
The JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler is a part of the JVM that converts bytecode into machine readable code. This helps Java applications run faster in various devices.
